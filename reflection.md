Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
  I could not attend the TA hours due to clash in my schedule and commuting issues.

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
  I used to program in java before by creating a GUI first and then coding parts of it. Directly coding into a bank sheet has been a new experience for me but I am finding it interesting. Java seems more complicated than python as you need define all the variables.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
  Python is a interpeter while java is a compiler. I personally find java more organized than python and easier to use as I'm more used to it. Both language has their own use and are generally better to use for different purposes.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
  First when I built the chatbot I did not split the string hence, replace() would overwrite previous replaced strings creating a huge error in my program. To fix it, I refered to a code which I have stated in the program which helped me overide the bug. I still can not figure out the canned response were my code would need to reply with a set of premade response with the mirrored words were not present in the string. Instead my code returns the same string with the addition of ?. I'm still trying to figure out how to show the transcript of what the user presented at the end.
  I would advice someone taking the course in the future to manage time to consult with TAs which I could not as that would have been more helpful for me. I would also advice them for trying to code the program by yourself and consulting with the internet as the last resort because if you try to search the code for the program from the start, it will lead you to lose the uniqueness and orginality of your program.
